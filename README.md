# clustering-implementation
This code implements clustering algorithms on the RDD input data by using two distance functions: euclidean distance and cosine similarity. Hyper-parameters and algorithm selection are done at the start of the code. The clustering results are stored in a .txt file

The code is written in Databricks notebook before it is exported.
